# Homebrew on macOS: declarative management of casks, formulae, and Mac App Store apps.
# Aerospace is managed by nix-darwin services, not Homebrew.
# Karabiner-Elements via Homebrew until nix-darwin#1679 lands (key config still via home-manager).
# Ghostty has no nixpkgs macOS build; config is shared via home/features/cli/ghostty.nix.
# cmux wraps Ghostty's renderer; reads ~/.config/ghostty/config + its own ~/.config/cmux/settings.json.
# onActivation.cleanup = "zap" removes anything not declared here -- add before installing.
