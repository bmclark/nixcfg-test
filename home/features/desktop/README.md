# Desktop Features

Window manager, Wayland desktop services, browsers, fonts, and keyboard remapping for the graphical environment.

## Start Here

On the NixOS laptop (`maverick`), the desktop is built around **Hyprland**:
- Hyprland manages windows and workspaces.
- Waybar shows status and workspace state.
- Wofi launches apps.
- Dunst handles notifications.
- Hyprlock locks the screen.
- Ghostty is the main terminal app.

On the macOS host (`iceman`), the desktop is built around **Aerospace** plus **Karabiner**:
- Aerospace manages windows and workspaces.
- Karabiner maps `CapsLock -> Ctrl` and physical `Ctrl -> Hyper`.
- Raycast is the app launcher.
- Ghostty is the main terminal app.

## What To Use When

| Tool | Use it for | Prefer it over |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Hyprland / Aerospace | Moving windows, switching workspaces, layout control | Using app-level tabs or panes to simulate OS-level workspace management |
| Wofi / Raycast | Launching apps quickly | Digging through menus |
| Waybar | Seeing workspace state, media, battery, network, bluetooth, audio | Opening multiple settings panels just to check status |
| Hyprlock | Locking the session | Logging out when you only need to step away |
| Firefox | Primary browser with stronger privacy defaults | Chromium for normal daily browsing |
| Chromium / Google Chrome | Compatibility fallback | Firefox when a site is broken or requires Chromium behavior |
| Karabiner | macOS keyboard remapping for the shared Ctrl / Hyper layout | Per-app remapping by hand |
| Remmina | Remote desktop sessions such as the Mac Screen Sharing setup | Ad hoc VNC command lines when you want saved profiles or a GUI |

## Desktop Movement And Navigation

In these docs, `Hyper` means the physical `Ctrl` key. Logical `Ctrl` lives on `CapsLock`.
The shortcut tables below lead with the physical keys you actually press.

### Shared Hyper layer

These bindings exist on both hosts:

| Physical key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Return` | Open a new terminal |
| `Ctrl+D` | Open the app launcher |
| `Ctrl+Space` | Toggle floating for the current window |
| `Ctrl+F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close the active window |
| `Ctrl+1` .. `Ctrl+0` | Switch to workspace 1..10 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+1` .. `Ctrl+Shift+0` | Move current window to workspace 1..10 |
| `Ctrl+Left` / `Right` / `Up` / `Down` | Focus window left / right / up / down |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Left` / `Right` / `Up` / `Down` | Move window left / right / up / down |

### Linux-specific Hyprland bindings

These are the extra bindings provided on `maverick`:

| Physical key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+E` | Open Thunar |
| `Ctrl+L` | Lock screen |
| `Ctrl+Escape` | Open logout/power menu |
| `Ctrl+\`` | Toggle the dropdown terminal |
| `Ctrl+,` / `Ctrl+.` | Previous / next workspace |
| `Alt+Tab` / `Alt+Shift+Tab` | Cycle windows forward / backward |
| `Alt+F4` | Close active window |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Area screenshot |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Print` | Full screenshot |
| `Ctrl+Alt+S` | Area screenshot and annotate in Swappy |
| `Ctrl+Alt+O` | OCR selected screen region to clipboard |
| `Ctrl+V` | Clipboard history picker |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Pick a screen color to the clipboard |

### macOS-specific Aerospace bindings

These are the extra bindings or behaviors on `iceman`:

| Shortcut / command | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+\`` | Jump to workspace `S` scratch space |
| `Ctrl+,` / `Ctrl+.` | Previous / next workspace |
| `Ctrl+E` | Open Finder |
| `Ctrl+L` | Lock screen |
| `Cmd+Tab` | Native macOS app switching |
| `drs` | Rebuild nix-darwin |
| `drt` | Check nix-darwin config without switching |

Hyprland mouse actions:

| Physical key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Left click drag` | Move window |
| `Ctrl+Right click drag` | Resize window |
| `Ctrl+mouse wheel` | Cycle workspaces |

Hyprland touchpad:

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Three-finger horizontal swipe | Change workspace |

### Workspaces and automatic placement

Some apps are placed on fixed workspaces on both hosts:

| Workspace | Purpose | macOS apps | Linux apps |
|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| `1` | Admin | Mail, Notes, Calendar, Bitwarden | thunderbird, notes, calendar, Bitwarden |
| `2` | Browser | Safari, Google Chrome | firefox, chromium |
| `3` | AI / chat | Claude, ChatGPT, Codex | Claude, ChatGPT |
| `4` | Editor | Emacs, Code, Xcode | Emacs, Code |
| `5` | Terminal | Ghostty | Ghostty |
| `6` | Media | Spotify, Audacity, GarageBand, iMovie | Spotify, Audacity |

That means a good default workflow is:
- `Ctrl+4` for editing/coding
- `Ctrl+2` for browser work
- `Ctrl+5` for terminal work
- use later workspaces for project-specific terminals, chat, or misc apps

### Scratch access

On `maverick`, `Ctrl+\`` opens a terminal on a special hidden workspace that drops down from the top of the screen.

Use it for:
- quick commands
- short notes
- one-off git or system checks

Do not treat it as your main long-lived work area; that is better handled by a normal Ghostty window with tmux inside.

On `iceman`, `Ctrl+\`` toggles into and back out of workspace `S`. Use it the same way if you keep a scratch Ghostty window there.

## Browsers

### Firefox

Firefox is the primary browser.

| Profile | Launch | Use for |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `default` | `firefox` | Day-to-day browsing with the strongest privacy defaults |
| `relaxed` | `firefox -P relaxed` | Sites that break under hardened settings |

Shared extensions include Bitwarden, uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Dracula, Dark Reader, and xBrowserSync.

### Chromium

Chromium is the compatibility browser. Use it when:
- a site needs Chromium-specific behavior
- DRM/video behavior differs
- enterprise tooling is unreliable in Firefox

## Cross-Platform App Parity

Apps now installed on both hosts through Nix or nixpkgs where possible:
- `gemini-cli` via home-manager on both hosts
- Bitwarden desktop on Linux via nixpkgs, Bitwarden on macOS via Mac App Store
- Spotify on Linux via nixpkgs, Spotify on macOS via Homebrew cask
- Audacity on Linux via nixpkgs, Audacity on macOS via Homebrew cask

Still not shared declaratively on `maverick`:
- `tdd-guard` is the remaining Linuxbrew candidate; this repo does not manage Linuxbrew yet
- `Claude` desktop app is macOS-only
- `ChatGPT` desktop app is macOS-only
- macOS-only system tools remain mac-only: Aerospace, Karabiner-Elements, Raycast, Logitech G Hub

## Remote Desktop

`maverick` includes Remmina for remote desktop sessions.

For the macOS Screen Sharing setup in this repo:
- launch Remmina from Wofi for a GUI workflow
- or run `iceman-remote` in a shell
- pass a Tailscale IP if MagicDNS is not resolving: `iceman-remote 100.x.y.z`

The helper defaults to `iceman`, which matches the macOS host name managed in the Darwin config.
Authenticate the Mac to Tailscale from the menu bar app on `iceman`; the Linux side only needs the reachable host name or Tailscale IP.

## Desktop Services

### Waybar

Waybar surfaces workspaces, the active window, media, system stats, bluetooth, network, audio, battery, tray, weather, and clock.

Use it as the desktop dashboard:
- check workspace occupancy before switching
- verify bluetooth/network/audio state quickly
- watch battery and media state without opening extra apps

### Dunst

Dunst provides notifications with history and app-specific rules.

Useful behaviors:
- notification history is available through `dunstctl history-pop`
- left click triggers the default action
- middle click closes all notifications
- right click closes the current notification

### Thunar and removable media

Thunar is the lightweight graphical file browser on `maverick`.

Use it for:
- browsing directories visually
- opening and ejecting USB/thumb drives
- quick archive handling through the archive plugin
- opening a terminal in the selected directory
- copying full file paths from the context menu
- running OCR on selected images or PDFs from the context menu

Removable media is automounted by `udiskie`, so mounted drives should show up in Thunar automatically.

### OCR and document helpers

`maverick` includes a lightweight OCR workflow:
- `ocrshot` or `Ctrl+Alt+O` grabs a screen region, OCRs it, and copies the text
- `ocrimg <file>` OCRs an image and copies the text
- `ocrpdf <file> [page]` OCRs a PDF page and copies the text
- `zathura <file.pdf>` opens PDFs in a keyboard-friendly viewer

### Hyprlock and idle flow

The session follows a staged idle chain:
- screen dims after 5 minutes
- lock engages after 15 minutes
- displays power down after 20 minutes

Use `Ctrl+L` when leaving the machine instead of waiting for idle.

## macOS Notes

Karabiner does not remap `Cmd` any more. The current model is:

- `CapsLock` sends logical `Ctrl`
- physical `Ctrl` sends `Hyper`
- `Cmd` stays native for macOS GUI shortcuts

Practical effect:
- `Cmd+C`, `Cmd+V`, `Cmd+Q`, and `Cmd+Tab` keep their normal macOS behavior
- `Ctrl+Return` launches Ghostty
- `Ctrl+D` launches Raycast
- `Ctrl+E` opens Finder
- `Ctrl+L` locks the screen
- `Ctrl+1..0` and `Ctrl+Shift+1..0` manage Aerospace workspaces
- `Ctrl+,` / `Ctrl+.` cycle the persistent `1..10` workspaces
- Karabiner still needs Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions after install

## Platform Notes

- **Chromium:** Linux-only (`pkgs.chromium` is not available on aarch64-darwin). On macOS, Google Chrome is installed via Homebrew cask (`darwin/common/homebrew.nix`) as the Chromium replacement.
- **Firefox:** available on both platforms via nixpkgs.

## Design Notes

- Hyprland owns window and workspace movement; tmux and Emacs should not be used as substitutes for desktop-level workspace switching.
- Use Ghostty tabs sparingly and tmux heavily if you want durable terminal workflows.
- The keyboard model is intentionally split: logical `Ctrl` on `CapsLock`, `Hyper` on physical `Ctrl`, native `Cmd` preserved on macOS.
- Browser strategy is Firefox first, Chromium second.
